# File-Crawler-v3
This lab was the extension of lab 6 and lab 4. We had to make more efficient file crawler so it was spider 3.0.
After multi-threading in the previous lab we had to use regular expressions as key words to find in the directories or text files.
Moreover, using Maven to automate.
I used lab 4 to do this lab as the requirement was to implement regular expression and not multi-threading required to do so.
I implemented only crawling.
I made unit tests but not really implemented them.
